1.Implement cipher block chain cryptography mechanism , encrypt transaction data and out it in block chain. Decrypt at receiver end.
2. Similarly implement counter mode encryption over transaction data in block chain decrypt at receiver end.
3. Implement AES algorithm for encryption over block chain transaction data.
4. Execute openssl commands for AES encryption, encoding over a text file. And do decryption also use open SSL commands.
