# 1. Java Code to Implement Mining Using Blockchain

Blockchain is a budding technology that has tremendous scope in the coming years. It is a modern technology that stores data in the form of blocks connected through cryptography and cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin. It was introduced by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta in 1991. 

A blockchain can be visualized as a linked list where the nodes are the blocks, and the references are hashes of the previous block in the chain. These references are cryptographic hashes. Each node will store a reference to the next node, and in this case, the references are cryptographic hashes.

Blockchain uses hash pointers to reference the previous node in a long list. We assign a hash to every single node because this is how we can identify them.

# 2. AIM: Creating a Cryptocurrency Wallet

There are four basic steps to create a cryptocurrency wallet:

1. **Choose the type of wallet.**
2. **Sign up for an account, buy the device, or download the software needed.**
3. **Set up security features, including a recovery phrase.**
4. **Purchase cryptocurrency or transfer coins from another wallet or exchange.**

## Types of Crypto Wallets

There are three basic types of wallets for virtual currency:

- **Software Wallet (Hot Wallet):** This type stores your crypto on an internet-connected device that you own.
  
- **Cold Wallet:** A specialized piece of hardware that keeps your crypto offline, providing added security.
  
- **Custodial Wallets:** These wallets leave your crypto in the control of a company you trust, such as a crypto exchange.
